/**
 * Decorators can be attached to an Array Controller (and hence also another
 * decorator) to form a chain of controllers. Decorating an Array Controller
 * basically means to reorder or filter elements in it. All modifications to the
 * decorator are propagated to the root controller which then bubbles events
 * back through the chain (or possibly chains) of decorators.
 *
 * The order of which decorators are added can greatly affect performance and
 * behavior. For instance, if the decoration chain is
 * ArrayController <- sortDecorator <- filterDecorator it will mean that
 * sortDecorator will keep a sorted list of the whole arrayController and
 * filter will take out the wanted elements. If instead we change the order to
 * Arraycontroller <- filterDecorator <- sortDecorator, sortDecorator will only
 * be aware of elements that passed the filter, meaning it will have less data
 * to operate on, improving performance.
 *
 * An example when behavior changes is in the comparison of these two decorator
 * chains:
 * 1. ac <- sortDecorator <- paginationDecorator
 * 2. ac <- paginationDecorator <- sortDecorator
 *
 * In case 1 sortDecorator will sort all elements and let paginationDecorator
 * operate on a sorted list. In case 2 pagination happens first, so the list
 * gotten from
 * sortDecorator will still be sorted, but the elements on the
 * page will only be sorted amongst themselves, and other
 * elements could fit inside the page, if only they were checked.
 * The behavior of case 2 is probably unwanted.
 *
 * Problems might arise when lazy load is added, so changes
 * will probably be made, but their magnitude is unknown ATM.
 *
 * The array controller implements Chain of Responsibility (CoR). CoR methods
 * propagate a method call to the decorator's component and lets client
 * programmers call methods on inner decorators. Say we are using the setup
 * ArrayController <- PaginationDecorator <- SortDecorator (meaning each page's
 * contents will be individually sorted). If the client wants to modify the page
 * of the paginator he would normally have to be aware of the order of the
 * decorations and call sorter.getComponent.setPage(n), but since the paginator
 * tells ArrayControllerDecorator to implement CoR for setPage, the sorter will
 * propagate the request to the next component which is the paginator and the
 * method can be executed successfully. Note that if we were to have two
 * decorators implementing the same method, there will be no way for the CoR to
 * know that that's the case and the outermost decorator will receive the call.
 *
 * Terminology:
 *   Decorator is an instance of ArrayControllerDecorator
 *   Component is the object that is decorated by the decorator.
