/**
 * @file
 * The event iterator (EI) is an iterator that processes event based objects
 * sequentially. It should be used when a list of objects all should
 * perform the same operation. When working with events, objects might
 * finish their operations after an arbitrary amount of time has passed,
 * meaning observers have to be attached and we may not continue
 * processing the next item until the current one sends out this event.
 *
 * EventIterator is an abstraction of the behavior necessary to accomplish
 * this task. One instance should be created for every iteration performed.
 * It behaves in the same way as forEach does on an array of regular
 * objects (performing an operation on each item, not gathering a result).
 *
 * An example of when EI is used is for Queue in the animation library.
 * Queue contains a list of animations, each animation should be performed,
 * but an animation may not start until the one before it has finished.
 * Using EI to solve this problem adds a fundamental requirement
 * for the animation objects we are iterating through:
 * - An animation must send an EventSubscription message when it has
 *   finished animating.
 * onFinished is an appropriately named event, signifying that event in the
 * animation package.
 * Queues startForward method would then have the following body:
 * {
 *   var ei = new EventIterator (this.queue, "startForward", "Finished");
 *   ei.subscribe("Finish", this);
 *   ei.startForward();
 * }
 * the `subscribe` line is our queue object observing when the event
 * iterator finishes, so that it itself can send out a Finished event
 * (Queue being a subclass of Animation.Abstract after all).
 *
 * You can also add functions that are executed before and after each
 * iteration, on the current item. Pass that function to the
 * setBeforeProcessing and setAfterProcessing methods after
 * instantiating the EI. Note that afterProcessing is called after
 * the current item sends out its "finished" event.
